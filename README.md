## Quizzes and how to reflect on them 
Your quizzes are marked as follows:<br />
Each question has 2 marks:<br />
- 2 marks if the answer is correct or close to correct.<br /> 
- 1 mark if the answer written is incorrect but relevant. <br />
- 0 if  no answer is written or the answer is irrelevant to the question.<br />
When you receive your marked quiz, you can recover one 1 mark back for each reflection on a mistake.<br /> 
For example: <br />
Say the quiz has total of 8 questions (therefore total of 16 marks) and your mark is "10 / 5" . This means you have recived 10 marks for the quiz and you had 5 mistakes in your quiz. By reflecting on these 5 mistakes you can get 5 marks back and your total mark will increase to 15 out of 16 instead of 10 out of 16.<br /> 
This is how you can reflect:<br /> 
On matrix create a file called q?reflect.txt. Replace the "?" with the number of the quiz. (i.e q2reflect.txt for quiz number 2).<br />
In this file write The quiz version and the questions you made a mistake in. Then write what your mistake was and finally write the correct answer to the question.<br />
To submit this file to me issue the following command:<br />
~fardad.soleimanloo/submit q?_ref&lt;ENTER&gt; (replace the "?" with the number of the quiz)<br />

## Citation and Sources 
In all the at-home part of your workshops, also Project and assignment deliverables, a file called **sources.txt** must be present. This file will be submitted with your work automatically.<br />   
You are to write either of the following statements in the file "sources.txt":<br /><br />
"I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments."<br />
Then add your name and your student number"<br /><br />
OR:<br /><br />
Write exactly which part of the code of the workshops or the assignment are given to you as help and who gave it to you or which source you received it from. <br />
You need to mention the workshop name or assignment name and also the file name and the parts in which you received the code for help.<br />
Finally add your name and student number at the bottum.<br /><br />
By doing this you will only lose the mark for the parts you got help for, and the person helping you will be clear of any wrong doing. 


## Git
[Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book): This is and online complete reference to git and its commands (command line). I recommend reading chapter 1 and 2 and glancing chapter 6. This will be more than enough to get your through atleast first three semesters of college, if not all. <br />
